# Tor on Pocketbook

Use https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3929494 if you have an issue and can't narrow down proper cause/repro as other users on there may help you. Github is strictly for the technical side, not support.

You'll need https://github.com/ezdiy/pocketbook-sdk5 to compile this. You may try with https://github.com/blchinezu/pocketbook-sdk for older devices, though it may miss some headers you'll have to fix up.
