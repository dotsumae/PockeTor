# Tor on Pocketbook
* Works only on FW5 (2016+), but can be probably compiled with older SDK. Patches for multi-sdk build welcome.
* Extract to applications/ on main storage
* Run @Pocketor from apps menu.
* If net is off, it will be forced on.
* Then Tor connection notices appear. Once bootstrap says its 100% done, you can change URL to browse.
